## Summary

This page lists the **annotated references** of the manuscript.  
Annotations emphasize a subset of the bibliography entries.  
Each annotated entry receives:

1. Prioritization on a 3-point scale as one of the following:
   1. a work of interest \(•\)
   2. a work of special interest \(••\)
   3. a work of outstanding interest \(•••\)
2. Brief characterization of major findings and significance.

The 3-point scale takes after the conventions of series such as Annual Reviews and Current Opinions.  
The descriptions follow an Elsevier Highlights rubric.
