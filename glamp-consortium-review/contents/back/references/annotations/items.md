  * Served as foundation for many succeeding \(colorimetric\) RT-LAMP COVID-19 papers

* STARS: 3
* ANNOTE
  * Describes application of DARQ for sequence-specific detection of SARS-CoV2 amplicons
  * Multiplexing of SARS-CoV2 and influenza virus as pathogens leading to similar symptoms
  * Related to another sequence-specific detection method \(QUASR, Betkas et al., 2021\) 
  * Enables real-time fluorescence monitoring c.f end-point measurement for QUASR
