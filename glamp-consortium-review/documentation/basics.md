# Basics \(FAQ\)

## **About**

### **What is the gLAMP Review?**

See: [About § gLAMP Review](../../#glamp-review)

### When are things happening?

2020 schedules were not carried over from prior docs.

## **Authorship**

### **What is the authorship model?**

1. ‘Football team’ of co-authors and supporting contributors.
2. Co-authors help to write, collate, and synthesize contributions.
3. Sections prioritize topics of importance to the collective.

### Who is a section lead?

**Section Leads** are corresponding authors for their respective sections.

### **Who is a contributor?**

**Volunteering Contributors** write one or more elements for inclusion \(½-¾ page each\). We expect these contributions to be ‘close to home’ for the contributor and hence not a significant overhead to write. These can be a cliff note summary of a contributor’s presentation to a Thursday gLAMP, of a preprint, or a summary of an aspect of LAMP testing literature that they have particularly focused on.

**Solicited Contributors** are individuals that section leads will contact with a request for ½-¾ page on a particular topic for which we currently do not have coverage. If subsequent encouragement is needed, please let us know.

### **Who gets writing credit?**

**Everyone who contributes to the review will receive authorship credit.**
