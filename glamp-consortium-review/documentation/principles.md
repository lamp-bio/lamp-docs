### Time-Sensitive Claims

Over the course of a series of writing and discussion sessions, we systematically audited the work for time-sensitive claims. Our essential objectives were the following:

1. Minimize reliance on time-sensitive information related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
2. Refer readers to reliable resources which we anticipate will continue to receive ongoing updates.
3. Identify the set of time-sensitive claims which we consider to be irreducible.
4. Plan to update those facts and figures from \[3\] at time of publication.

Ultimately, we reduced the list of items in updates at publication time to two items:

1. EUA Metadata: quantity, typological characteristics, and performance data for LAMP-based IVDs.
2. Variant Analysis: VOCs, 'topline' summaries on primer impacts, etc.

### Viewpoints

We have taken great care to be inclusive with respect to the work's many authors. We strongly feel that the breadth and depth of the authors' demographic and viewpoint diversity is to the work's ultimate benefit.
