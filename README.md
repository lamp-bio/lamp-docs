## gLAMP

### Global LAMP Consortium

The Global LAMP \(gLAMP\) Consortium was founded in April 2020, in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic as a diverse group of stakeholders including scientists, engineers, physicians, educators, government officials, philanthropists, and more, who came together to address the global challenges in detecting SARS-CoV-2. As new results kept being reported on pre-prints posted on bioRxiv and medRxiv, it quickly became clear that LAMP technology showed great potential in providing rapid, accurate, and scalable diagnostics. Indeed, there are several different applications and approaches to LAMP methods that can be modified and adapted to various testing goals such as point-of-care clinical testing, community screening, monitoring city sewage samples, or swabbing urban spaces. gLAMP currently has over 300 members spanning academic labs, industry teams, non-profit, community biology, and government agencies. The group meets virtually every week to share IRB protocols, best practices, latest results from pilot experiments, reagent suppliers, and logistic experiences. The goal is to create an open environment where results can be shared to accelerate research as fast as possible and deploy the most optimal testing methods to the field.

### gLAMP Central

gLAMP Central refers to planning around the creation of companion infrastructure to benefit ongoing gLAMP calls, in the spirit of "rough consensus and working code".

### gLAMP Review

The gLAMP review is the first project resulting from gLAMP Central planning discussion. It is a collaborative synopsis of the key methods and developments shared over the course of 2020.
