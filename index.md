#### Schedule Changes

* Since March 2021, gLAMP R&D calls have been reduced in frequency.
  * Calls were previously on a weekly schedule. They're now monthly.
  * Calls are on the first Thursday of the month, unless announced otherwise.
* Since March 2021, gLAMP Review calls no longer occur on any fixed schedule.
  * The review has been submitted. Routine writing calls are no longer needed!
  * The standing zoom link remains available for miscellaneous use.
* gLAMP Members: please feel free to use the 'Writing Call' zoom link for impromptu meets.
  * The 'Regular Call' zoom link is also Chris Mason's general lab meeting link!
  * So please prefer the otherwise-unused Writing link over that one, to avoid gatecrashing.
