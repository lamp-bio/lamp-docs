## Content Removal Notice

This documentation page has been minimized and/or subpages have been pruned.  
This happens for one of, or a combination of, the following reasons:  


1. The contents needlessly aided confusion or clutter in current context.
2. The contents are no longer sufficiently synchronized  to remain accurate, public notes.
3. The contents previously discussed publication-centric information. This content is of no public interest at this time. The authors have elected not to maintain indefinite public access â€” at least for now.  Note that the lead authors are committed to maximal transparency and accessibility. All of the gLAMP Review's dependencies have been selected with open access in mind.  Further, all published content tied to the review's process is being archived for public use. These web archives are a comprehensive snapshot of the LAMP landscape c. 2020-2021. They will be published in 2021 and remain available indefinitely thereafter.  \(One author directs a preservation nonprofit applying synbio technologies to ['GLAM'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_%28industry%29)\)
